A project i created to make a html/css/js program that will eventually count to a googleplex even though it may take billions of years with current technology with new advances it should help calculate a list of numers from 0 to a googleplex.

PS: The 2 files are supposed to be in the "Saves" folder but i uploaded them to the wrong spot.
